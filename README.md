### Messing with Python

Found a question online (a Facebook interview question) and tried to solve it and implement it using Python. The question is: 
> Given a stack of integers, reverse the values at the odd indexes. 
> For example, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] becomes [0, 7, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1, 8]. 
> There are no guarantees as to the contents of the stack, 
> and you may only use ONE stack as auxiliary storage.
